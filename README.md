# A Rubik's Cube Simulator

## Technologies
- HTML, CSS for GUI
- JavaScript for logic
- WebGL API for rendering Rubik's Cube and apply rubik's cube movement, transition, rotation, camera and scene

## Knowledges
- Basic knowlegde of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of 
  - WebGL API
  - Perspective, clipping planes, field of view, far place, near place
  - matrix, identity matrix, transformation matrix, rotation matrix

## Feature
- Create Custom functional 3D rubik's cube at any size (2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 11x2x5, 4x5x9, etc)
- Multiple render option (outer layer, inner cubes, inner planes, changing point size, etc)
- Each color of 6 layers can be changed with hex color
- Customizable Camera Properties (camera position in 3d, position for camera to look at in 3d)
- Customizable Rubik's Cube orientation and position
- Customizable Scene (Field of View, near plane, far plane)
